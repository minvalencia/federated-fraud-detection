# Fraud Detection Scoring System Explained

## 1. Feature Weights Deep Dive

### Transaction Amount (Weight: 2.0)
```python
2.0 * (TransactionAmount > 90th_percentile)
```
- **Why Highest Weight?**
  - Most direct indicator of fraud
  - Fraudsters typically attempt large transactions
  - 90th percentile threshold captures unusual activity
  - Example: If typical transactions are $100, a $5000 transaction gets high weight

### Login Attempts (Weight: 1.5)
```python
1.5 * (LoginAttempts > 2)
```
- **Security Significance**
  - Multiple attempts suggest password guessing
  - Threshold of 2 attempts is based on normal user behavior
  - Binary feature (yes/no) rather than continuous
  - Example: 3+ login attempts immediately adds 1.5 to score

### Account Balance (Weight: 1.5)
```python
1.5 * (AccountBalance < 10th_percentile)
```
- **Context Importance**
  - Low balance often precedes fraud
  - 10th percentile captures unusually low balances
  - Correlates with account takeover attempts
  - Example: Balance < $100 when typical is $1000+

### Transaction Duration (Weight: 1.0)
```python
1.0 * (TransactionDuration > 90th_percentile)
```
- **Behavioral Indicator**
  - Longer durations suggest automated attacks
  - Less reliable than other indicators
  - Used as supporting evidence
  - Example: 5-minute transaction when typical is 1 minute

## 2. Score Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Clear Fraud
```
Scenario:
- Transaction Amount: $5000 (> 90th percentile) → 2.0
- Login Attempts: 4 attempts → 1.5
- Account Balance: Normal → 0.0
- Duration: Long (> 90th percentile) → 1.0

Total Score = 4.5 > 2.5 (Threshold) → FRAUD
```

### Example 2: Borderline Case
```
Scenario:
- Transaction Amount: Normal → 0.0
- Login Attempts: 3 attempts → 1.5
- Account Balance: Very low (< 10th percentile) → 1.5
- Duration: Normal → 0.0

Total Score = 3.0 > 2.5 (Threshold) → FRAUD
```

### Example 3: Normal Transaction
```
Scenario:
- Transaction Amount: Normal → 0.0
- Login Attempts: 1 attempt → 0.0
- Account Balance: Normal → 0.0
- Duration: Long (> 90th percentile) → 1.0

Total Score = 1.0 < 2.5 (Threshold) → NOT FRAUD
```

## 3. Threshold Selection (2.5)

### Why 2.5?
1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Captures ~3.90% of transactions
   - Aligns with industry fraud rates (2-5%)
   - Balances false positives and negatives

2. **Combination Requirements**:
   - Requires multiple indicators
   - Can't trigger on single feature
   - Needs strong evidence or multiple moderate signals

### Valid Fraud Combinations
```
1. Major Red Flags:
   Transaction Amount (2.0) + Login Attempts (1.5) = 3.5

2. Multiple Moderate Indicators:
   Login Attempts (1.5) + Low Balance (1.5) = 3.0

3. Mixed Signals:
   Transaction Amount (2.0) + Duration (1.0) = 3.0
```

## 4. Real-time Adaptation

### Dynamic Thresholds
```python
amount_threshold = df['TransactionAmount'].quantile(0.90)
balance_threshold = df['AccountBalance'].quantile(0.10)
duration_threshold = df['TransactionDuration'].quantile(0.90)
```
- Percentiles auto-adjust to data
- Handles different scales across banks
- Adapts to changing patterns

### Score Distribution
Typical distribution in dataset:
- Score 0-1: ~70% of transactions
- Score 1-2: ~20% of transactions
- Score 2-2.5: ~6.1% of transactions
- Score >2.5: ~3.9% of transactions (flagged as fraud)

## 5. Integration with ML Model

### Feature Engineering
```python
feature_columns = [
    'TransactionAmount',    # Raw + Scored
    'LoginAttempts',        # Raw + Scored
    'AccountBalance',       # Raw + Scored
    'TransactionDuration',  # Raw + Scored
    'CustomerAge'          # Additional context
]
```

### Score Usage
1. **Direct Feature**:
   - Score used as model input
   - Provides pre-filtered signal

2. **Threshold Tuning**:
   - Model can adjust thresholds
   - Learns from historical data

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Model performance influences scoring
   - Weights can be adjusted based on results

## 6. Performance Metrics
